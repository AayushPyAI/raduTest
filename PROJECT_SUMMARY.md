# Patent Semantic Search System - Project Summary

## Overview

This system provides AI-powered semantic search over the worldwide patent database, enabling inventors, patent attorneys, and researchers to find relevant prior art with unprecedented accuracy and speed. The system goes beyond traditional keyword-based searches by understanding concepts and technical relationships, dramatically improving the quality of patent discovery.

## Problem Statement

Traditional patent search has significant limitations:
- **Keyword Dependency**: Misses semantically similar patents using different terminology
